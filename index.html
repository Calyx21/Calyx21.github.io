I'm always here to support you in everything you want to do in life. I'm pretty sure that your father is also happy where he is right now because his beloved daughter is slowly but surely succeeding in her life.

I will always be here supporting and loving you, mahal, and always remember that nothing is impossible. So you better take care of yourself and always be careful in everything you do, especially at work. Hope to see you soon, my love! Happy Happy Happy Birthday! I love you and I will always love you.
